The\nvalue returned by [getInterceptor] holds the methods separately from the\nstate of the instance.  The compiler converts the methods on an interceptor\nto take the Dart `this` argument as an explicit `receiver` argument.  The\nJavaScript `this` parameter is bound to the interceptor.\n\nIn order to have uniform call sites, if a method is defined on an\ninterceptor, methods of that name on plain unintercepted classes also use the\ninterceptor calling convention.
