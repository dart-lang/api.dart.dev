The\nvalue returned by [getInterceptor] holds the methods separately from the\nstate of the instance.  The compiler converts the methods on an interceptor\nto take the Dart `this` argument as an explicit `receiver` argument.  The\nJavaScript `this` parameter is bound to the interceptor.\n\nIn order to have uniform call sites, if a method is defined on an\ninterceptor, methods of that name on plain unintercepted classes also use the\ninterceptor calling convention.  The plain classes are _self-interceptors_,\nand for them, `getInterceptor(r)` returns `r`.  Methods on plain\nunintercepted classes have a redundant `receiver` argument and should ignore\nit in favour of `this`.\n\nIn the case of mixins, a method may be placed on both an intercepted class\nand an unintercepted class.  In this case, the method must use the `receiver`\nparameter.\n\n\nThere are various optimizations of the general call pattern.\n\nWhen the interceptor can be statically determined, it can be used directly:\n\n    CONSTANT_INTERCEPTOR.foo$1(r, a)\n\nIf there are only a few classes, [getInterceptor] can be specialized with a\nmore efficient dispatch:\n\n    getInterceptor$specialized(r).foo$1(r, a)\n\nIf it can be determined that the receiver is an unintercepted class, it can\nbe called directly:\n\n    r.foo$1(r, a)\n\nIf, further, it is known that the call site cannot call a foo that is\nmixed-in to a native class, then it is known that the explicit receiver is\nignored, and space-saving dummy value can be passed instead:\n\n    r.foo$1(0, a)\n\nThis class defines implementations of *all* methods on [Object] so no\ninterceptor inherits an implementation from [Object].  This enables the\nimplementations on Object to ignore the explicit receiver argument, which\nallows dummy receiver
