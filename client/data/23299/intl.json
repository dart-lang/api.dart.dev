It generally involves text\ncontaining different types of alphabets, but may also refer to boustrophedon,\nwhich is changing text directionality in each row.\n\nUtility class for formatting display text in a potentially\nopposite-directionality context without garbling layout issues.\nMostly a very \"slimmed-down\" and dart-ified port of the Closure Birectional\nformatting libary. If there is a utility in the Closure library (or ICU, or\nelsewhere) that you would like this formatter to make available, please\ncontact the Dart team.\n\nProvides the following functionality:\n\n1. *BiDi Wrapping*\nWhen text in one language is mixed into a document in another, opposite-\ndirectionality language, e.g. when an English business name is embedded in a\nHebrew web page, both the inserted string and the text following it may be\ndisplayed incorrectly unless the inserted string is explicitly separated\nfrom the surrounding text in a \"wrapper\" that declares its directionality at\nthe start and then resets it back at the end. This wrapping can be done in\nHTML mark-up (e.g. a 'span dir=rtl' tag) or - only in contexts where mark-up\ncan not be used - in Unicode BiDi formatting codes (LRE|RLE and PDF).\nProviding such wrapping services is the basic purpose of the BiDi formatter.\n\n2. *Directionality estimation*\nHow does one know whether a string about to be inserted into surrounding\ntext has the same directionality? Well, in many cases, one knows that this\nmust be the case when writing the code doing the insertion, e.g. when a\nlocalized message is inserted into a localized page. In such cases there is\nno need to involve the BiDi formatter at all. In the remaining cases, e.g.\nwhen the string is user-entered or comes from a database, the language of\nthe string (and thus its directionality) is not known a priori, and must be\nestimated at run-time. The BiDi formatter does this automatically.\n\n3. *Escaping*\nWhen wrapping plain text - i.e. text that is not already HTML or HTML-\nescaped - in HTML mark-up, the text must first be HTML-escaped to prevent XSS\nattacks and other nasty business. This of course is always true, but the\nescaping cannot be done after the string has already been wrapped in\nmark-up, so the BiDi formatter also serves as a last chance and includes\nescaping services.\n\nThus, in a single call, the formatter will escape the input string as\nspecified, determine its directionality, and wrap it as necessary. It is\nthen up to the caller to insert the return value in the output.\n","uri":"pkg/intl/lib/bidi_formatter.dart","name":"BidiFormatter","id":"BidiFormatter","children":[{"returnType":{"refId":"dart.core/String","name":"String"},"comment":"\nEscapes HTML-special characters of [text] so that the result can be\nincluded verbatim in HTML source code, either in an element body or in an\nattribute value.\n","name":"htmlEscape","id":"htmlEscape1()","children":[{"ref":{"refId":"dart.core/String","name":"String"},"name":"text","id":"text","kind":"param"}],"line":"89","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"dart.core/String","name":"String"},"comment":"\nFormats a string of a given (or estimated, if not provided)\n[direction] for use in HTML output of the context directionality, so\nan opposite-directionality string is neither garbled nor garbles what\nfollows it.\nIf the input string's directionality doesn't match the context\ndirectionality, we wrap it with a `span` tag and add a `dir` attribute\n(either \"dir=rtl\" or \"dir=ltr\").\nIf alwaysSpan was true when constructing the formatter, the input is always\nwrapped with `span` tag, skipping the dir attribute when it's not needed.\n\nIf [resetDir] is true and the overall directionality or the exit\ndirectionality of [text] is opposite to the context directionality,\na trailing unicode BiDi mark matching the context directionality is\nappended (LRM or RLM).

Date elements that vary across\nlocales include month name, weekname, field, order, etc.\n\nFormatting dates in the default \"en_US\" format does not require any\ninitialization. e.g.\n      print(new DateFormat.yMMMd().format(new Date.now()));\n\nBut for other locales, the formatting data for the locale must be\nobtained. This can currently be done\nin one of three ways, determined by which library you import. In all cases,\nthe \"initializeDateFormatting\" method must be called and will return a future\nthat is complete once the locale data is available. The result of the future\nisn't important, but the data for that locale is available to the date\nformatting and parsing once it completes.\n\nThe easiest option is that the data may be available locally, imported in a\nlibrary that contains data for all the locales.\n      import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_local.dart';\n      initializeDateFormatting(\"fr_FR\", null).then((_) => runMyCode());\n\nIf we are running outside of a browser, we may want to read the data\nfrom files in the file system.\n      import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_file.dart';\n      initializeDateFormatting(\"de_DE\", null).then((_) => runMyCode());\n\nIf we are running in a browser, we may want to read the data from the\nserver using the XmlHttpRequest mechanism.\n      import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_http_request.dart';\n      initializeDateFormatting(\"pt_BR\", null).then((_) => runMyCode());\n\nThe code in example/basic/basic_example.dart shows a full example of\nusing this mechanism.\n\nOnce we have the locale data, we need to specify the particular format.\nThis library uses the ICU/JDK date/time pattern specification both for\ncomplete format specifications and also the abbreviated \"skeleton\" form\nwhich can also adapt to different locales and is preferred where available.\n\nSkeletons: These can be specified either as the ICU constant name or as the\nskeleton to which it resolves.

Otherwise does not apply\n* 4 or more pattern letters--use full form,\n* 3 pattern letters--use short or abbreviated form if one exists\n* less than 3--use numeric form if one exists\n\n**Number**: the minimum number of digits. Shorter numbers are zero-padded to\nthis amount (e.g. if \"m\" produces \"6\", \"mm\" produces \"06\"). Year is handled\nspecially; that is, if the count of 'y' is 2, the Year will be truncated to\n2 digits. (e.g., if \"yyyy\" produces \"1997\", \"yy\" produces \"97\".) Unlike other\nfields, fractional seconds are padded on the right with zero.\n\n**(Text & Number)**: 3 or over, use text, otherwise use number.\n\nAny characters not in the pattern will be treated as quoted text. For\ninstance, characters like ':', '.', ' ', '#' and '@' will appear in the\nresulting text even though they are not enclosed in single quotes. In our\ncurrent pattern usage, not all letters have meanings. But those unused\nletters are strongly discouraged to be used as quoted text without quotes,\nbecause we may use other letters as pattern characters in the future.\n\nExamples Using the US Locale:\n\n    Format Pattern                     Result\n    --------------                     -------\n    \"yyyy.MM.dd G 'at' HH:mm:ss vvvv\"  1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 Pacific Time\n    \"EEE, MMM d, ''yy\"                 Wed, July 10, '96\n    \"h:mm a\"                           12:08 PM\n    \"hh 'o''clock' a, zzzz\"            12 o'clock PM, Pacific Daylight Time\n    \"K:mm a, vvv\"                      0:00 PM, PT\n    \"yyyyy.MMMMM.dd GGG hh:mm aaa\"     01996.July.10 AD 12:08 PM\n\nWhen parsing a date string using the abbreviated year pattern (\"yy\"),\nDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some\ncentury. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20\nyears after the time the parse function is called. For example, using a\npattern of \"MM/dd/yy\" and a DateParse instance created on Jan 1, 1997,\nthe string \"01/11/12\" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string\n\"05/04/64\" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964. During parsing, only\nstrings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by {@link\njava.lang.Character#isDigit(char)}, will be parsed into the default\ncentury. Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or\nmore digit string will be interpreted as its face value.\n\nIf the year pattern does not have exactly two 'y' characters, the year is\ninterpreted literally, regardless of the number of digits.
