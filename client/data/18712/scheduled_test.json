This allows the tests to\nread like synchronous, linear code, despite executing asynchronously.\n\nThe `scheduled_test` package is built on top of `unittest`, and should be\nimported instead of `unittest`. It provides its own version of [group],\n[test], and [setUp], and re-exports most other APIs from unittest.\n\nTo schedule a task, call the [schedule] function. For example:\n\n    import 'package:scheduled_test/scheduled_test.dart';\n\n    void main() {\n      test('writing to a file and reading it back should work', () {\n        schedule(() {\n          // The schedule won't proceed until the returned Future has\n          // completed.\n          return new File(\"output.txt\").writeAsString(\"contents\");\n        });\n\n        schedule(() {\n          return new File(\"output.txt\").readAsString().then((contents) {\n            // The normal unittest matchers can still be used.\n            expect(contents, equals(\"contents\"));\n          });\n        });\n      });\n    }\n\n## Setting Up and Tearing Down\n\nThe `scheduled_test` package defines its own [setUp] method that works just\nlike the one in `unittest`. Tasks can be scheduled in [setUp]; they'll be\nrun before the tasks scheduled by tests in that group. [currentSchedule] is\nalso set in the [setUp] callback.\n\nThis package doesn't have an explicit `tearDown` method. Instead, the\n[currentSchedule.onComplete] and [currentSchedule.onException] task queues\ncan have tasks scheduled during [setUp]. For example:\n\n    import 'package:scheduled_test/scheduled_test.dart';\n\n    void main() {\n      var tempDir;\n      setUp(() {\n        schedule(() {\n          return createTempDir().then((dir) {\n            tempDir = dir;\n          });\n        });\n\n        currentSchedule.onComplete.schedule(() => deleteDir(tempDir));\n      });\n\n      // ...\n    }\n\n## Passing Values Between Tasks\n\nIt's often useful to use values computed in one task in other tasks that are\nscheduled afterwards. There are two ways to do this. The most\nstraightforward is just to define a local variable and assign to it. For\nexample:\n\n    import 'package:scheduled_test/scheduled_test.dart';\n\n    void main() {\n      test('computeValue returns 12', () {\n        var value;\n\n        schedule(() {\n          return computeValue().then((computedValue) {\n            value = computedValue;\n          });\n        });\n\n        schedule(() => expect(value, equals(12)));\n      });\n    }\n\nHowever, this doesn't scale well, especially when you start factoring out\ncalls to [schedule] into library methods. For that reason, [schedule]\nreturns a [Future] that will complete to the same value as the return\nvalue of the task. For example:\n\n    import 'package:scheduled_test/scheduled_test.dart';\n\n    void main() {\n      test('computeValue returns 12', () {\n        var valueFuture = schedule(() => computeValue());\n        schedule(() {\n          valueFuture.then((value) => expect(value, equals(12)));\n        });\n      });\n    }\n\n## Out-of-Band Callbacks\n\nSometimes your tests will have callbacks that don't fit into the schedule.\nIt's important that errors in these callbacks are still registered, though,\nand that [Schedule.onException] and [Schedule.onComplete] still run after\nthey finish. When using `unittest`, you wrap these callbacks with\n`expectAsyncN`; when using `scheduled_test`, you use [wrapAsync].\n\n[wrapAsync] has two important functions. First, any errors that occur in it\nwill be passed into the [Schedule] instead of causing the whole test to\ncrash. They can then be handled by [Schedule.onException] and\n[Schedule.onComplete]. Second, a task queue isn't considered finished until\nall of its [wrapAsync]-wrapped functions have been called. This ensures that\n[Schedule.onException] and [Schedule.onComplete] will always run after all\nthe test code in the main queue.\n\nNote that the [completes], [completion], and [throws] matchers use\n[wrapAsync] internally, so they're safe to use in conjunction with scheduled\ntests.\n\nHere's an example of a test using [wrapAsync] to catch errors thrown in the\ncallback of a fictional `startServer` function:\n\n    import 'package:scheduled_test/scheduled_test.dart';\n\n    void main() {\n      test('sendRequest sends a request', () {\n        startServer(wrapAsync((request) {\n          expect(request.body, equals('payload'));\n          request.response.close();\n        }));\n\n        schedule(() => sendRequest('payload'));\n      });\n    }\n\n## Timeouts\n\n`scheduled_test` has a built-in timeout of 30 seconds (configurable via\n[Schedule.timeout]). This timeout is aware of the structure of the schedule;\nthis means that it will reset for each task in a queue, when moving between\nqueues, or almost any other sort of interaction with [currentSchedule]. As\nlong as the [Schedule] knows your test is making some sort of progress, it\nwon't time out.\n\nIf a single task might take a long time, you can also manually tell the\n[Schedule] that it's making progress by calling [Schedule.heartbeat], which\nwill reset the timeout whenever it's called.","line":"154"}
