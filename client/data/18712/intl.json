It generally involves text\ncontaining different types of alphabets, but may also refer to boustrophedon,\nwhich is changing text directionality in each row.\n\nUtility class for formatting display text in a potentially\nopposite-directionality context without garbling layout issues.\nMostly a very \"slimmed-down\" and dart-ified port of the Closure Birectional\nformatting libary. If there is a utility in the Closure library (or ICU, or\nelsewhere) that you would like this formatter to make available, please\ncontact the Dart team.\n\nProvides the following functionality:\n\n1. *BiDi Wrapping*\nWhen text in one language is mixed into a document in another, opposite-\ndirectionality language, e.g. when an English business name is embedded in a\nHebrew web page, both the inserted string and the text following it may be\ndisplayed incorrectly unless the inserted string is explicitly separated\nfrom the surrounding text in a \"wrapper\" that declares its directionality at\nthe start and then resets it back at the end. This wrapping can be done in\nHTML mark-up (e.g. a 'span dir=rtl' tag) or - only in contexts where mark-up\ncan not be used - in Unicode BiDi formatting codes (LRE|RLE and PDF).\nProviding such wrapping services is the basic purpose of the BiDi formatter.\n\n2. *Directionality estimation*\nHow does one know whether a string about to be inserted into surrounding\ntext has the same directionality? Well, in many cases, one knows that this\nmust be the case when writing the code doing the insertion, e.g. when a\nlocalized message is inserted into a localized page. In such cases there is\nno need to involve the BiDi formatter at all. In the remaining cases, e.g.\nwhen the string is user-entered or comes from a database, the language of\nthe string (and thus its directionality) is not known a priori, and must be\nestimated at run-time. The BiDi formatter does this automatically.\n\n3. *Escaping*\nWhen wrapping plain text - i.e. text that is not already HTML or HTML-\nescaped - in HTML mark-up, the text must first be HTML-escaped to prevent XSS\nattacks and other nasty business. This of course is always true, but the\nescaping cannot be done after the string has already been wrapped in\nmark-up, so the BiDi formatter also serves as a last chance and includes\nescaping services.\n\nThus, in a single call, the formatter will escape the input string as\nspecified, determine its directionality, and wrap it as necessary. It is\nthen up to the caller to insert the return value in the output.\n","line":"58"},{"superclass":{"name":"Object","refId":"dart.core/Object"},"id":"_Stream","name":"_Stream","children":[{"returnType":{"name":"bool","refId":"dart.core/bool"},"id":"atEnd0()","name":"atEnd","kind":"method","line":"75"},{"id":"next0()","name":"next","kind":"method","line":"77"},{"id":"read1()","name":"read","children":[{"defaultValue":"1","isOptional":true,"id":"howMany","name":"howMany","kind":"param"}],"kind":"method","comment":"\nReturn the next [howMany] items, or as many as there are remaining.\nAdvance the stream by that many positions.\n","line":"83"},{"id":"peek1()","name":"peek","children":[{"defaultValue":"1","isOptional":true,"id":"howMany","name":"howMany","kind":"param"}],"kind":"method","comment":"\nReturn the next [howMany] items, or as many as there are remaining.\nDoes not modify the stream position.\n","line":"93"},{"id":"rest0()","name":"rest","kind":"method","comment":"Return the remaining contents of the stream ","line":"107"},{"returnType":{"name":"int","refId":"dart.core/int"},"id":"findIndex1()","name":"findIndex","children":[{"ref":{"name":"Function","refId":"dart.core/Function"},"id":"f","name":"f","kind":"param"}],"kind":"method","comment":"\nFind the index of the first element for which [f] returns true.\nAdvances the stream to that position.\n","line":"113"},{"returnType":{"name":"List","refId":"dart.core/List"},"id":"findIndexes1()","name":"findIndexes","children":[{"ref":{"name":"Function","refId":"dart.core/Function"},"id":"f","name":"f","kind":"param"}],"kind":"method","comment":"\nFind the indexes of all the elements for which [f] returns true.\nLeaves the stream positioned at the end.\n","line":"124"},{"returnType":{"name":"int","refId":"dart.core/int"},"id":"nextInteger0()","name":"nextInteger","kind":"method","line":"137"},{"id":"contents","name":"contents","kind":"variable","line":"70"},{"ref":{"name":"int","refId":"dart.core/int"},"id":"index","name":"index","kind":"variable","line":"71"},{"id":"digitMatcher","name":"digitMatcher","kind":"variable","line":"136"},{"id":"_Stream1()","name":"_Stream","children":[{"initializedField":{"name":"contents","refId":"intl/_Stream/contents"},"id":"contents","name":"contents","kind":"param"}],"kind":"constructor","line":"73"}],"uri":"pkg/intl/lib/src/date_format_helpers.dart","kind":"class","comment":"\nA simple and not particularly general stream class to make parsing\ndates from strings simpler.

is for formatting and parsing dates in a locale-sensitive\nmanner.\nIt allows the user to choose from a set of standard date time formats as well\nas specify a customized pattern under certain locales. Date elements that\nvary across locales include month name, week name, field order, etc.\nWe also allow the user to use any customized pattern to parse or format\ndate-time strings under certain locales. Date elements that vary across\nlocales include month name, weekname, field, order, etc.\n\nThe actual date for the locales must be obtained. This can currently be done\nin one of three ways, determined by which library you import. If you only\nwant to use en_US formatting you can use it directly, as a copy of that\nlocale is hard-coded into the formatter. In all other cases,\nthe [initializeDateFormatting] method must be called and will return a future\nthat is complete once the locale data is available. The result of the future\nisn't important, but the data for that locale is available to the date\nformatting and parsing once it completes.\n\nThe easiest option is that the data may be available locally, imported in a\nlibrary that contains data for all the locales.\n      import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_local.dart';\n      initializeDateFormatting(\"en_US\", null).then((_) => runMyCode());\n\nIf we are running outside of a browser, we may want to read the data\nfrom files in the file system.\n      import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_file.dart';\n      initializeDateFormatting(\"de_DE\", null).then((_) => runMyCode());\n\nIf we are running in a browser, we may want to read the data from the\nserver using the XmlHttpRequest mechanism.\n      import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_http_request.dart';\n      initializeDateFormatting(\"pt_BR\", null).then((_) => runMyCode());\n\nThe code in example/basic/basic_example.dart shows a full example of\nusing this mechanism.\n\nOnce we have the locale data, we need to specify the particular format.\nThis library uses the ICU/JDK date/time pattern specification both for\ncomplete format specifications and also the abbreviated \"skeleton\" form\nwhich can also adapt to different locales and is preferred where available.\n\nSkeletons: These can be specified either as the ICU constant name or as the\nskeleton to which it resolves. The supported set of skeletons is as follows\n     ICU Name                   Skeleton\n     --------                   --------\n     DAY                          d\n     ABBR_WEEKDAY                 E\n     WEEKDAY                      EEEE\n     ABBR_STANDALONE_MONTH        LLL\n     STANDALONE_MONTH             LLLL\n     NUM_MONTH                    M\n     NUM_MONTH_DAY                Md\n     NUM_MONTH_WEEKDAY_DAY        MEd\n     ABBR_MONTH                   MMM\n     ABBR_MONTH_DAY               MMMd\n     ABBR_MONTH_WEEKDAY_DAY       MMMEd\n     MONTH                        MMMM\n     MONTH_DAY                    MMMMd\n     MONTH_WEEKDAY_DAY            MMMMEEEEd\n     ABBR_QUARTER                 QQQ\n     QUARTER                      QQQQ\n     YEAR                         y\n     YEAR_NUM_MONTH               yM\n     YEAR_NUM_MONTH_DAY           yMd\n     YEAR_NUM_MONTH_WEEKDAY_DAY   yMEd\n     YEAR_ABBR_MONTH              yMMM\n     YEAR_ABBR_MONTH_DAY          yMMMd\n     YEAR_ABBR_MONTH_WEEKDAY_DAY  yMMMEd\n     YEAR_MONTH                   yMMMM\n     YEAR_MONTH_DAY               yMMMMd\n     YEAR_MONTH_WEEKDAY_DAY       yMMMMEEEEd\n     YEAR_ABBR_QUARTER            yQQQ\n     YEAR_QUARTER                 yQQQQ\n     HOUR24                       H\n     HOUR24_MINUTE                Hm\n     HOUR24_MINUTE_SECOND         Hms\n     HOUR                         j\n     HOUR_MINUTE                  jm\n     HOUR_MINUTE_SECOND           jms\n     HOUR_MINUTE_GENERIC_TZ       jmv\n     HOUR_MINUTE_TZ               jmz\n     HOUR_GENERIC_TZ              jv\n     HOUR_TZ                      jz\n     MINUTE                       m\n     MINUTE_SECOND                ms\n     SECOND                       s\n\nExamples Using the US Locale:\n\n     Pattern                           Result\n     ----------------                  -------\n     new DateFormat.yMd()             -> 07/10/1996\n     new DateFormat(\"yMd\")            -> 07/10/1996\n     new DateFormat.yMMMMd(\"en_US\")   -> July 10, 1996\n     new DateFormat(\"Hm\", \"en_US\")    -> 12:08 PM\n     new DateFormat.yMd().Hm()        -> 07/10/1996 12:08 PM\n\nExplicit Pattern Syntax: Formats can also be specified with a pattern string.\nThe skeleton forms will resolve to explicit patterns of this form, but will\nalso adapt to different patterns in different locales.\nThe following characters are reserved:\n\n    Symbol   Meaning                Presentation        Example\n    ------   -------                ------------        -------\n    G        era designator         (Text)              AD\n    y        year                   (Number)            1996\n    M        month in year          (Text & Number)     July & 07\n    L        standalone month       (Text & Number)     July & 07\n    d        day in month           (Number)            10\n    c        standalone day         (Number)            10\n    h        hour in am/pm (1~12)   (Number)            12\n    H        hour in day (0~23)     (Number)            0\n    m        minute in hour         (Number)            30\n    s        second in minute       (Number)            55\n    S        fractional second      (Number)            978\n    E        day of week            (Text)              Tuesday\n    D        day in year            (Number)            189\n    a        am/pm marker           (Text)              PM\n    k        hour in day (1~24)     (Number)            24\n    K        hour in am/pm (0~11)   (Number)            0\n    z        time zone              (Text)              Pacific Standard Time\n    Z        time zone (RFC 822)    (Number)            -0800\n    v        time zone (generic)    (Text)              Pacific Time\n    Q        quarter                (Text)              Q3\n    '        escape for text        (Delimiter)         'Date='\n    ''       single quote           (Literal)           'o''clock'\n\nThe count of pattern letters determine the format.\n\n**Text**:\n* 5 pattern letters--use narrow form for standalone. Otherwise does not apply\n* 4 or more pattern letters--use full form,\n* 3 pattern letters--use short or abbreviated form if one exists\n* less than 3--use numeric form if one exists\n\n**Number**: the minimum number of digits. Shorter numbers are zero-padded to\nthis amount (e.g. if \"m\" produces \"6\", \"mm\" produces \"06\"). Year is handled\nspecially; that is, if the count of 'y' is 2, the Year will be truncated to\n2 digits. (e.g., if \"yyyy\" produces \"1997\", \"yy\" produces \"97\".) Unlike other\nfields, fractional seconds are padded on the right with zero.\n\n**(Text & Number)**: 3 or over, use text, otherwise use number.\n\nAny characters not in the pattern will be treated as quoted text. For\ninstance, characters like ':', '.', ' ', '#' and '@' will appear in the\nresulting text even though they are not enclosed in single quotes. In our\ncurrent pattern usage, not all letters have meanings. But those unused\nletters are strongly discouraged to be used as quoted text without quotes,\nbecause we may use other letters as pattern characters in the future.\n\nExamples Using the US Locale:\n\n    Format Pattern                     Result\n    --------------                     -------\n    \"yyyy.MM.dd G 'at' HH:mm:ss vvvv\"  1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 Pacific Time\n    \"EEE, MMM d, ''yy\"                 Wed, July 10, '96\n    \"h:mm a\"                           12:08 PM\n    \"hh 'o''clock' a, zzzz\"            12 o'clock PM, Pacific Daylight Time\n    \"K:mm a, vvv\"                      0:00 PM, PT\n    \"yyyyy.MMMMM.dd GGG hh:mm aaa\"     01996.July.10 AD 12:08 PM\n\nWhen parsing a date string using the abbreviated year pattern (\"yy\"),\nDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some\ncentury. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20\nyears after the time the parse function is called. For example, using a\npattern of \"MM/dd/yy\" and a DateParse instance created on Jan 1, 1997,\nthe string \"01/11/12\" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string\n\"05/04/64\" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964. During parsing, only\nstrings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by {@link\njava.lang.Character#isDigit(char)}, will be parsed into the default\ncentury. Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or\nmore digit string will be interpreted as its face value.\n\nIf the year pattern does not have exactly two 'y' characters, the year is\ninterpreted literally, regardless of the number of digits. So using the\npattern \"MM/dd/yyyy\", \"01/11/12\" parses to Jan 11, 12 A.D.\n","line":"188"},{"superclass":{"name":"Object","refId":"dart.core/Object"},"id":"Intl","name":"Intl","children":[{"returnType":{"name":"DateFormat","refId":"intl/DateFormat"},"id":"date2()","name":"date","children":[{"ref":{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"},"isOptional":true,"id":"pattern","name":"pattern","kind":"param"},{"ref":{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"},"isOptional":true,"id":"desiredLocale","name":"desiredLocale","kind":"param"}],"kind":"method","comment":"\nReturn a new date format using the specified [pattern].\nIf [desiredLocale] is not specified, then we default to [locale].\n","line":"94"},{"isStatic":true,"returnType":{"name":"Future","refId":"dart.async/Future","arguments":[{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"}]},"id":"message6()","name":"message","children":[{"ref":{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"},"id":"message_str","name":"message_str","kind":"param"},{"ref":{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"},"isNamed":true,"defaultValue":"''","isOptional":true,"id":"desc","name":"desc","kind":"param"},{"ref":{"name":"Map","refId":"dart.core/Map"},"isNamed":true,"defaultValue":"const{}","isOptional":true,"id":"examples","name":"examples","kind":"param","line":"132"},{"ref":{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"},"isNamed":true,"isOptional":true,"id":"locale","name":"locale","kind":"param","line":"132"},{"ref":{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"},"isNamed":true,"isOptional":true,"id":"name","name":"name","kind":"param","line":"132"},{"ref":{"name":"List","refId":"dart.core/List","arguments":[{"name":"String","refId":"dart.core/String"}]},"isNamed":true,"isOptional":true,"id":"args","name":"args","kind":"param","line":"133"}],"kind":"method","comment":"\nReturns a message that can be internationalized.
